*   In a general Geometric Covering Problem a geometry is given and several *
* possible observation points are given from which the geometry can be      *
* observed. The goal is to find the minimum number of observation points    *
* which together observe the entire geometry, that is, covering the entire  *
* geometry.                                                                 *
*   In this problem we support this basic Geometric Covering Problem with   *
* few additions such as an occluding geometry which isn't required to be    *
* covered but can possibly interefer with the vision of some of the         *
* obsveration points.                                                       *
*                                                                           *
*   All the inputs are given to UserGCSolveGeoProblem by                    *
* UserGCProblemDefinitionStruct *Problem.                                   *
* Obstacles: An IPObjectStruct struct of type IP_OBJ_POLY. That is, the     *
*     input is expected to be a group of polygons. Any number of such       *
*     structs can be connected using Pnext (However, IP_OBJ_LIST_OBJ are    *
*     not acceptable). Any other types of inputs are just ignored. If       *
*     Obstacles is NULL, it's ignored.                                      *
* GeoObj: Has the same requirements as Obstacles. Additionally it must      *
*     contain UV parameterizatoin (See AttrSetUVAttrib) for every polygon.  *
*     Each IPObjectStruct in the connected Pnext list is considered as one  *
*     surface. The UV paremetrization of polygons in each surface mustn't   *
*     overlap each other. However, the UV parametrization between differen  *
*     surfaces are allowed to overlap each other since the algorithm        *
*     rearrange their UV parametrization in order to eliminate those        *
*     overalps. (the function IRndrVisMapPrepareUVValuesOfGeoObj rndr_lib.h *
*     can be used in order to eliminate overlapping between several         *
*     polygonal objects prior to calling UserGCSolveGeoProblem).            *
* ObsPtsGroups: Defines the observation points. This is a NULL terminated   *
*     vector of pointers to UserGCObsPtGroupTypeStruct (Which will be       *
*     referred here as suggestions group). Each suggestions group defines   *
*     several UserGCObsPtSuggestionStruct (Which will be referred here as   *
*     suggestion) which are used by the solver as possible obsevation       *
*     points for the Geometric Covering Problem. Those suggestions can be   *
*     defined in different ways according to                                *
*     ObsPtsGroups -> PredefinedSuggestions.PredefinedSuggestionType.       *
*     USER_GC_CUSTOM_SUGGESTION: The suggestions are given in               *
*         ObsPtsGroups -> Suggestions as a NULL terminated vector of        *
*         pointer of UserGCObsPtSuggestionStruct.                           *
*         Suggestions.Direction is the direction the observation point look *
*         at. Suggestions.ObsPt is the location of the observation point.   *
*         The location can be USER_GC_INF_VEC to mark infinity in           *
*         orthographic view.                                                *
*     USER_GC_SIX_MAIN_AXIS: The suggestions are the three main axis and    *
*         their antipodals.                                                 *
*     USER_GC_SPHERE_POLYHEDRON: A polyhedron such as dodecahedron is given *
*         in PredefinedSuggestionType.Polyhedron.Poly (no check is done     *
*         over the polygonal object to make sure it's a closed shape). The  *
*         polyhedron is divided into triangles. In each level each triangle *
*         is divided into four triangles by connecting the middles of its   *
*         three edges. When the levels end, the vertices of all the         *
*         triangles are normalized and used as locations over the unit      *
*         sphere. The number of levels is given by                          *
*         PredefinedSuggestionType.Polyhedron.Level                         *
*     USER_GC_SPHERE_COVER_#: A # number of location spread evenly over the *
*         unit sphere. # can be 4, 20, 50, 100 and 130.                     *
*     USER_GC_PERIMETER: Define guards in equals distance on a curver over  *
*         a terrain. The file PredefinedSuggestionType.Perimeter.CrfFileName*
*         must contain:                                                     *
*         1. An object containing a surface with the name "Terrain" (case   *
*            insensitive). The surface must face up. This can also be a     *
*            polygonal object as long as it has a parametrization and       *
*            normals pointing down (which means the surface points up).     *
*         2. An object containing a 2D curve (2 coordinates or 3 with z=0). *
*            The curve must be inside the parametric domain of the          *
*            surface (1).                                                   *
*            The tangents of the curve must point clockwise.                *
*         3. The file may contain one or more matrices (only the last one   *
*            is considered) which will be applied only on the surface.      *
*         There will be PredefinedSuggestionType.Perimeter.GuardsNumber     *
*         observation points. They will be placed on height                 *
*         PredefinedSuggestionType.Perimeter.GuardsHeight above the surface.*
*         The directions of the observation points will be perpendicular to *
*         the curve while tangent to the surface, pointing outside.         *
*     USER_GC_SURFACE_GRID: Define guards over a surface. The file          *
*         PredefinedSuggestionType.SurfaceGrid.SrfFileName must contain:    *
*         1. An object containing a surface with the name "Terrain" (case   *
*            insensitive). This can also be a polygonal object as long as it*
*            has a parametrization.                                         *
*         2. An object containing a 2D curve (2 coordinates or 3 with z=0). *
*            The curve must be inside the parametric domain of the          *
*            surface (1).                                                   *
*         3. An optional obstacle objects may be defined as well. Each      *
*            object must be a closed shape (surface of polygons).           *
*         4. The file may contain one or more matrices (only the last one   *
*            is considered) which will be applied only on the surface (1)   *
*            and obstacles (3).                                             *
*         PredefinedSuggestionType.SurfaceGrid.GuardsNumber[] defines       *
*         number of guards spread evenly on the x axis and y axis over the  *
*         parametric domain of the surface (1) in a height of               *
*         PredefinedSuggestionType.SurfaceGrid.GuardsHeight. If an          *
*         observation point is defined outside the 2D curve (2) or if it's  *
*         defined inside one of the obstacles (3) it is ignored.            *
*                                                                           *         
*       Notice that in all cases, the suggestiosn are defined regardless of *
*     the geometry defined by Problem -> GeoObj and Problem -> Obstacles.   *
*     It's the user's responsiblity to keep the the compatibility between   *
*     all the definitions.                                                  *
*       When ObsPtsGroups -> PredefinedSuggestions.PredefinedSuggestionType *
*     isn't USER_GC_CUSTOM_SUGGESTION, UserGCSolveGeoProblem interprets the *
*     PredefinedSuggestions into several suggestions and put them into      *
*     ObsPtsGroups -> Suggestions while setting                             *
*     ObsPtsGroups -> PredefinedSuggestions.PredefinedSuggestionType to     *
*     USER_GC_CUSTOM_SUGGESTION. This is an additional output of            *
*     UserGCSolveGeoProblem.                                                *
*       Each suggestions group has additional two parameters in ObsPtType.  *
*     ZAngle: The vertical aperture of all the suggestions in the           *
*         suggestions group. Allowed values are between 0 to 175 degrees.   *
*     XYAngle: The horizontal aperture of all the suggestions in the        *
*         suggestions group. Allowed values are between 0 to 360 degrees.   *
*         (for USER_GC_SURFACE_GRID this values is forced to be 360 degrees)*
* UVMap: A buffer in the size of the visiblity map (the visibility map is   *
*     described below) where value 0 mark a UV value which isn't required   *
*     to be covered. Notice that the UV values here are according to the    *
*     final UV values in the visibility maps regardless of the individual   *
*     UV domains of the different input objects in GeoObj.                  *
* SolvingParams:                                                            *
*     VisMapWidth, VisMapHeight: The dimensions of the visibilty map and the*
*         zbuffer used during the calculation of the visibilty map.         *
*     VisMapTanAng: The minimum allowed angle between the tangent plane of  *
*         any surface and the view direction of the camera. The angle is in *
*         degrees. Angles below that will render the pixel as invisible.    *
*     VisMapCriticAR: – The maximum allowed ratio between the largest    *
*         edge of a triangle and the smallest edge of a triangle. Ratios    *
*         above that will render the pixel as invisible. Value of 0 means   *
*         ignoring this limitation.                                         *
*     SetCoverParams: Parameter regarding the algoirhtm solving the set     *
*         cover done over the visibility maps in order to find the minimum  *
*         number of obervation points covering the geometry.                *
*         Algorithm: The algorithm used.                                    *
*             USER_GC_GREEDY: Selecting in each stage the visibility map    *
*                 which add the largest contribution to the total cover.    *
*             USER_GC_EXHAUSTIVE: Check all the possible combinations.      *
*             USER_GC_EXACT: Check all the possible combination starting    *
*                 from the most likely combinations. Cannot handle          *
*                 cases when less than 100% coverage is acceptable.         *
*         CoverLimit: Used in USER_GC_EXHAUSTIVE. Accept values between 0   *
*             to 1. Coverage equals or above CoverLimit is acceptable as    *
*             well. Value of 0 means to ignore this variable.               *
*         SizeLimit: Used in USER_GC_EXHAUSTIVE and USER_GC_EXACT. Look     *
*             for solutions with no more than SizeLimit number of           *
*             observation points.                                           *
* DebugParams: Those are described throughly in their definition below.     *
*                                                                           *
*   These are the output of UserGCSolveGeoProblem:                          *
* int: The function returns FALSE if it failed (e.g. because of missing     *
*     file).                                                                *
* SolutionOps: A NULL terminated pointers for UserGCSolutionIndexStruct     *
*     (referred here as solutions) which are the solving observation points *
*     of the Geometric Covering Problem. Each solution contain three        *
*     indices pointing to one suggestion in Problem -> ObsPtsGroups.        *
*     ObsPtGroupIndex: The index of the suggestions group in                *
*         Problem -> ObsPtsGroups.                                          *
*     SuggestionIndex: The index of the suggestion inside the suggestions   *
*         group pointed by ObsPtGroupIndex (This also true when             *
*         ObsPtsGroups -> PredefinedSuggestions.PredefinedSuggestionType    *
*         isn't USER_GC_CUSTOM_SUGGESTION and the suggestions are           *
*         interpreted by UserGCSolveGeoProblem).                            *
*     Index: All the suggestions in all the suggestions groups can be       *
*         enumerated. Enumerate the suggestions in the first suggestions    *
*         group, then the suggestions in the second suggestions group and   *
*         so on. Index points to the index of the suggestion in this        *
*         enumeration.                                                      *
* CoverPercentage: This is the final cover percentage achieved by the       *
*     observation points given in SolutionOps. This is calculated as the    *
*     total number of covered pixel in the visibilty map                    *
*     (RNDR_VISMAP_EMPTY_COLOR) divided by the total number of non empty    *
*     pixels (any pixel except RNDR_VISMAP_DEGEN_COLOR and                  *
*     RNDR_VISMAP_EMPTY_COLOR) in the visibility map (see definitino of     *
*     visibility map below).                                                *
*                                                                           *
*   This is a good place to define visibilty map.                           *
*   Visibility map is a map defined for each observation point over the UV  *
* parametrization. The visibilty map refers to the UV domain after the      *
* changes applied for each input surface in order to prevent overlaps       *
* (when only single surface is given, it may also have its UV               *
* parametrization changed abit). Since the visibilty maps is defined over   *
* the parameterizaiton domain, each pixel corresponds to part of the        *
* geometry to cover. Therefore, each pixel marks the visibility of the      *
* corresponding part of the geometry from the related observation point.    *
* The different possible color values and there meanings are defined in     *
* rndr_lib.h:                                                               *
* RNDR_VISMAP_EMPTY_COLOR: A pixel which doesn't correspond to any part of  *
